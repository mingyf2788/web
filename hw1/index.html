<!--因为我对于CSS中元素的定位这些内容不是太熟悉，所以这次作业在修改的时候就使用了大量的块级元素-->
<!--对于其中的元素基本都使用了相对定位方法，现在对于元素定位有了更好的认识-->

        <h2> Brief Introduction </h2>

        <p>
                A pie is a baked dish which is usually made of a pastry dough casing that covers or completely contains
            a filling of various sweet or savoury ingredients. Pies are defined by their crusts. A filled pie (also 
            single-crust or bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the filling is placed on top of the
            pastry but left open. A top-crust pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry
            or other covering before baking. A two-crust pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. 
            Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, but many things can be used, including 
            baking powder biscuits, mashed potatoes, and crumbs.Pies can be a variety of sizes, ranging from bite-size
            to ones designed for multiple servings.
